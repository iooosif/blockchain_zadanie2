1. Vysvetlite, prečo pridávanie a odoberanie likvidity na vašej burze nezmení výmenný kurz.


# The exchange rate remains unchanged when liquidity is added because the liquidity provider must
#supply both ETH and tokens in a ratio that reflects the current exchange rate.
#For example, if the pool contains 1000 tokens and 10 ETH (a 100:1 ratio), and a provider adds
#1 ETH, they must also contribute 100 tokens. The pool will then contain 1100 tokens and 11 ETH,
#maintaining the 100:1 ratio. As a result, the exchange rate is preserved.


2. K bonusu - Vysvetlite svoju schému odmeňovania poskytovateľov likvidity a zdôvodnite rozhodnutia o dizajne, ktoré ste urobili. Ako spĺňa požiadavky na odmeny za likviditu uvedené v sekcii 7?


# Initialization
#When the first provider adds liquidity, the ‘shares‘ variable is initialized based on the total ETH in the
#pool (existing reserves plus the newly added ETH). The provider’s ownership is stored in the ‘lp shares‘
#mapping.
#Subsequent Additions
#For additional providers, shares are calculated proportionally as follows:
#provider share = (msg.value × shares)/eth reserves

#Partial Withdrawal
#If a provider chooses to withdraw part of their liquidity, the corresponding share adjustment is calcu-
#lated using:
#share correction = (amountETH × shares)/eth reserves

#This amount is deducted from both the provider’s share and the total share pool.
#Full Withdrawal
#To withdraw all liquidity, the amount of ETH and tokens sent to the user’s wallet is computed as:
#amountETH = (user share × eth reserves)/shares

#amountTokens = (amountETH × token reserves)/eth reserves

#Transaction Fee
#A transaction fee of 3% is applied to each trade and retained in the liquidity pool, benefiting all
#liquidity providers by increasing the total pool value.
#Compliance with Requirements
#• The logic for rewarding liquidity providers is implemented in the methods: addLiquidity,
#removeAllLiquidity, and removeLiquidity.
#• Fee is set to be 3%
#• User always retrieve the amount of ETH and tokens according to the respective share in the
#liquidity pool



3. Popíšte aspoň jednu metódu, ktorú ste použili na minimalizáciu spotreby gas pri kontrakte burzy. Prečo bola táto metóda efektívna?


#Technics for spending less gas
#• Performing necessary operations only after validity checks of input data (e.g balance checks),
#which minimizes the number of operations
#• Lack of repeated calculations during swaps and other operatio
